# Two Axis Rudder ROV

## Introduction
This project involves an underwater remotely operated vehicle equipped with a top-mounted, two-axis rudder. By adjusting its rudder rotation, it can optimize its travel speed when traveling in the same direction or against the flow. It can also determine its orientation relative to the surrounding flow using a flow rate sensor and self-adjust the rudder to a preprogrammed angle.

## Code
Upload ```console.ino``` to the microcontroller on the remote console and ```robot.ino``` to the one in the ROV.
